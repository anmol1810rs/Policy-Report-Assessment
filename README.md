# Binary Classification Model & Finite State Machine Assessments
Name: Anmol Malhotra

This repository contains two assignments:

- **Assignment 1 (A1):** Finding the best threshold for a binary classification model with recall â‰¥ 0.9.
- **Assignment 2 (A2):** Implementing a Finite State Machine (FSM) to compute the remainder when a binary string is divided by 3.

---

## Setup & Execution

Each assignment is placed in a separate folder:  
- `A1/` â†’ Assignment 1 (Threshold Selection for Classification)  
- `A2/` â†’ Assignment 2 (Finite State Machine for Mod-n Calculation)

### Running the Assignments

#### **Assignment 1 - Threshold Selection**
1. Navigate to the assignment folder:
   ```sh
   cd A1
   python main.py

#### **Assignment 2 - Fine State Machine for Mod-n Calculation**
2. Navigate to the assignment folder:
   ```sh
   cd A2
   python main.py

```bash
